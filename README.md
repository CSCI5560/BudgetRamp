# BudgetRamp

## Introduction
BudgetRamp is a three-tiered platform focused on financial analytics and fraud detection, designed to address the challenges of processing massive amounts of transaction data for individuals, small and micro businesses, and financial institutions. The system utilizes a React-Vite-Tailwind front-end, a Node.js/Express back-end, and a MySQL database with over 23 million transaction records. Through reusable UI components and a parameter-adjustable API, it provides users with real-time dashboards, transaction details, fraud notifications, user profiles, and reporting. The back-end leverages connection pooling and optimized indexing to ensure query scalability, while the database categorizes and stores core financial elements such as users, cards, and transactions. It also reserves space for machine learning integration with a dedicated table to store fraud prediction probabilities. BudgetRamp demonstrates the power of modern database technology to support high-volume analysis and fraud detection, while providing flexibility for real-world financial applications.
